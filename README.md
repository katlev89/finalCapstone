Project Name: Amazon Product Review Sentiment Analysis

Description:
The Amazon Product Review Sentiment Analysis project aims to analyse the sentiment of product reviews from Amazon 
using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It processes text data from Amazon product reviews, 
preprocesses the text, and then applies sentiment analysis to determine whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral. 
The importance of this project lies in its ability to provide insights into customer opinions and sentiments towards products, 
helping businesses understand customer feedback and make informed decisions.
